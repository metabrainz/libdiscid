Libdiscid supports many platforms and the disc access code
for every platform is different.
Since you need physical machines with a CD drive to test a platform,
we do need your help!

The platform specific code is in the src/disc_*.c files.
These have to implement the *_unportable functions given
in include/discid/discid_private.h
The main function being mb_disc_read_unportable,
where the mb_disc_private struct is filled with data.
Parts of the data are optional features that don't need to be
implemented (ISRC, MCN). The TOC always has to be read.

You are free on how to implement the features defined in discid.h,
but it might help for many advanced features
when mb_scsi_cmd_unportable is implemented on the platform.
After this is done, the scsi functions available in src/scsi.h
can be used.
These functions are implemented as scsi commands,
which in itself should be platform independent.
