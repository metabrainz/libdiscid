Build and Installation of Libdiscid
===================================

You can either use the autotools or Cmake to build libdiscid.


Cmake
-----

    cmake .

You can disable NLS (libintl/gettext) with:

    cmake -DDISABLE_NLS=1 .


Autotools
---------

    ./configure

You can disable NLS (libintl/gettext) with:

    ./configure --disable-nls


Both
----

After you created the Makefiles you normally issue

    make
    make install

and test with:

    make check

API documentation is created with:

    make docs


Tips for Windows
----------------

For most systems cmake and autotools work (nearly) "out of the box".
On Windows the build was tested using MinGW and running in the MinGW shell:

    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles"
    make

You can also create Visual Studio project files.
Just type "cmake" to see a list of options.


Notes for BSD
-------------

With Cmake builds the library version/soname will work the same as on Linux.
With the Autotools, libtool is used and generates sonames as major+minor.
For NetBSD there seems to be a change with libdiscid 0.4.0, where libtool now
seems to use Linux versioning (soversion=major).

Please make sure that the correct soname is used.
Libdiscid still has major version 0 and is backwards compatible to 0.1.0.
