Build and Installation of Libdiscid
===================================

You can either use the GNU build system (autotools) or Cmake to build libdiscid.
No additionaly tools (except a C compiler) are required.
An out-of-source build is recommended.

Cmake
-----
    mkdir _build; cd _build/
    cmake ..
    make
    make check
    make install


Autotools
---------
    mkdir _build; cd _build/
    ../configure
    make
    make check
    make install


Both
----
Optional API documentation in HTML format is created by Doxygen with:

    make docs


Compiler flags
--------------

The following defines can be used to change the build:

DISCID_USE_HTTPS: If set, the functions discid_get_submission_url and
  discid_get_webservice_url will generate URLs using the HTTPS protocol instead
  of HTTP. This might break existing applications that rely on the exact URL
  structure being returned.

To enable this feature when using CMake, change the cmake command from above to:

    cmake -DENABLE_USE_HTTPS=ON …

To enable this feature when using Autotools, change the configure command from above to:

    ../configure --enable-use-https=yes

NOTE: Having DISCID_USE_HTTPS enabled will become the default in a future release.
      Please prepare your code to not rely on the specific URL protocol for URLs
      generated by libdiscid.


Building from git repository
----------------------------
If you fetched the source with git, you should either
use Cmake (no difference to the source distribution)
or have autoconf, automake and libtool installed and do ./autogen.sh
before doing the usual build.


Tips for Windows
----------------
For most systems cmake and autotools work (nearly) "out of the box".
On Windows you should use Cmake.

Building with MinGW in the MinGW/MSYS shell:

    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ..
    make

Building with NMake (MS Visual Studio command line):

    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
    nmake


Notes for BSD
-------------
With Cmake builds the library version/soname will work the same as on Linux.
With the Autotools, libtool is used and generates sonames as major+minor.
For NetBSD there seems to be a change with libdiscid 0.4.0, where libtool now
seems to use Linux versioning (soversion=major).

Please make sure that the correct soname is used.
Libdiscid still has major version 0 and is backwards compatible to 0.1.0.
