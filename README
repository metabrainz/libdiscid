A Library for creating MusicBrainz DiscIDs
------------------------------------------

libdiscid is a C library for creating MusicBrainz DiscIDs from audio CDs.
It reads a CD's table of contents (TOC) and generates an identifier which
can be used to lookup the CD at MusicBrainz (http://musicbrainz.org).
Additionally, it provides a submission URL for adding the DiscID to the
database.

The library also provides FreeDB disc IDs, and MCN + ISRCs, if available.

The interface of this library is new, but the DiscID algorithm and the
operating system dependent CD-ROM/DVD-ROM access code have been ported
from libmusicbrainz version 2. 


There are no required dependencies. However, when not using GNU Libc,
an external libintl and iconv are needed for Native Language Support (NLS).
See INSTALL how to disable NLS.
Users of GNU/Linux have NLS support without dependencies.
