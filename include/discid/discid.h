 * \mainpage libdiscid
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * Libdiscid is a C library for calculating DiscIDs
 * (<a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Disc ID">MusicBrainz</a>
 * and <a href="http://freedb.org">freedb</a>)
 * for Audio CDs.
 * Additionally the library can extract the MCN/UPC/EAN and the
 * <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/ISRC">ISRCs</a> from disc.
 *
 * The idea is to have an easy to use library without any dependencies
 * that can be used from scripting languages.
 *
 * The API is documented in discid.h.
 *
 * \section examples Examples
 *
 * This is an example of the most basic usage:
 *
 * \code
 *
 * DiscId *disc = discid_new();
 *
 * if ( discid_read_sparse(disc, "/dev/cdrom", 0) == 0 ) {
 *     fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", discid_get_error_msg(disc));
 *     return 1;
 * }
 * 
 * printf("DiscID        : %s\n", discid_get_id(disc));
 * printf("Submit via    : %s\n", discid_get_submission_url(disc));
 *
 * discid_free(disc); 
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * \section Building
 *
 * libdiscid provides a pkg-config script that returns the necessary compiler and linker flags, as well as the
 * version number.  To build a small sample program one would use:
 *
 * @par
 * <tt>gcc libdiscid-test.c \`pkg-config libdiscid --cflags --libs\` -o libdiscid-test</tt>
 *
